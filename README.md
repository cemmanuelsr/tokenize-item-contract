A blockchain contract to tokenize in-game items

## Setup

You need to install Python first, use the [official documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install Vyper running `pip install vyper==0.3.3`, for more details on how to install other vyper versions or use Vyper with docker, consult the [vyper install guide](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing-vyper.html).

Install pipx running `python3 -m pip install pipx` and then run `python3 -m pipx ensurepath`. Now, having pipx installed run `pipx install eth-brownie`.

Test if setup was successful running `brownie` on command line.

If you keep having problems, try to run `pip install brownie` too. Otherwise, read the [brownie official install guide](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing-vyper.html).
